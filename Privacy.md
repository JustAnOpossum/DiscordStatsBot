## What Data is Collected?
The data that we collect includes

1. User ID of members in the server where the bot is added, unless opted out
2. Name of activity that a user is playing.
3. Number of hours that the user has played that activity

# Data Shared With 3rd Parties
The only data that we share with 3rd parties is the name of games that are played. This is for the purpose of retrieving the image of a game that a user is playing.

The data is not shared with any identifying information about the user.

This does not delete existing data.
